**Optimisation of Superconducting Quantum Circuits with Automatic Differentiation**

transmon_fluxonium_plots created Fig1 and Fig2

AD_gradient_descent_fluxonium is the RMAD optimiser for the fluxonium - created Fig4 and Table 1

Simulation_Arb_Circuits_gradient_descent is an attempt at a numerical fininite difference algorithim for optimising dephasing on the fluxonium

Other files are plots and exploratory work with scqubits
